## PhotoShare

A simple application written in laravel 5.1 to allow you to share photos with family and friends but have some security also. You can limit who can see each photo album and the photos in it.

## Setup

In order to create an administrator go through the registration process then modify the record in the database and set `is_admin` value to `1`. Eventually I'll probably make it so the first person registered will be an administrator. You can make other users administrators from the user list when logged in as an administrator.
